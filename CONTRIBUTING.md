###Scope 

We would love to have your help in developing `rentrez`. Bear in mind, `rentrez`
is intended to be a general-purpose wrapper for the `Eutils` API. Functions that
make use of `rentrez` to perform more specific tasks should be added to existing
packages, or form the basis of new ones. 

###Perferred way to contribute code

* Fork this repo to your Github account
* Clone your version on your account down to your machine from your account, e.g,. `git clone https://github.com/<yourgithubusername>/rentrez.git`
* Make sure to track progress upstream (i.e., on our version of `rentrez` at `ropensci/rentrez`) by doing `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ropensci/rentrez.git`. Before making changes make sure to pull changes in from upstream by doing either `git fetch upstream` then merge later or `git pull upstream` to fetch and merge in one step
* Make your changes (bonus points for making changes on a new branch)
* Push up to your account
* Submit a pull request to home base at `ropensci/rentrez`
