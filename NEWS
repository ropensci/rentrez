Version 0.4.1
---------------------
* Bug fix: The example for entrez_summary contained a typo which made it fail
  (being wrapped in dontest this hadn't previously shown up).

Version 0.4
------------------------
 * entrez_summary now fetches 'version 2.0' esummary records from NCBI
     * This change may break some scripts. In particular, the names of some
       elements in esummary records have changed. Broken scripts shold produce a
       helpful error message, and using entrez_summary(..., version="1.0")
       should fix it. More details are given in the help to entrez_summary. 
     * When version 2.0 records are requested entrez_summary fetches the json
       record.
 * New helper functions for einfo Eutil
    * entrez_dbs() lists avaliable databases.
    * entrez_db_summary() gets summary information about a given database.  
    * entrez_db_links() lists databases against which a given db's records might
      be cross referenced.
