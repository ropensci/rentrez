\title{Get summaries of objects in NCBI datasets from a unique ID}
\usage{
entrez_summary(
  db,
  id = NULL,
  web_history = NULL,
  version = c("2.0", "1.0"),
  always_return_list = FALSE,
  retmode = NULL,
  config = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{db}{character Name of the database to search for}

\item{id}{vector with unique ID(s) for records in database \code{db}.
In the case of sequence databases these IDs can take form of an
NCBI accession followed by a version number (e.g. AF123456.1 or AF123456.2)}

\item{web_history}{A web_history object}

\item{version}{either 1.0 or 2.0 see above for description}

\item{always_return_list}{logical, return a list  of esummary objects even
when only one ID is provided (see description for a note about this option)}

\item{retmode}{either "xml" or "json". By default, xml will be used for
version 1.0 records, json for version 2.0.}

\item{config}{vector configuration options passed to \code{httr::GET}}

\item{\dots}{character Additional terms to add to the request, see NCBI
documentation linked to in references for a complete list}
}
\value{
A list of esummary records (if multiple IDs are passed and
always_return_list is FALSE) or a single record.

file XMLInternalDocument xml file containing the entire record
returned by the NCBI.
}
\description{
The NCBI offer two distinct formats for summary documents.
Version 1.0 is a relatively limited summary of a database record based on a 
shared Document Type Definition. Version 1.0 summaries are only available as
XML and are not available for some newer databases
Version 2.0 summaries generally contain more information about a given
record, but each database has its own distinct format. 2.0 summaries are 
available for records in all databases and as JSON and XML files. 
As of version 0.4, rentrez fetches version 2.0 summaries by default and
uses JSON as the exchange format (as JSON object can be more easily converted
into native R types). Existing scripts which relied on the structure and
naming of the "Version 1.0" summary files can be updated by setting the new
\code{version} argument to "1.0".
}
\details{
By default, entrez_summary returns a single record when only one ID is
passed and a list of such records when multiple IDs are passed. This can lead
to unexpected behaviour when the results of a variable number of IDs (perhaps the
result of \code{entrez_search}) are processed with an apply family function
or in a for-loop. If you use this function as part of a function or script that
generates a variably-sized vector of IDs setting \code{always_return_list} to 
\code{TRUE} will avoid these problems. The function
\code{extract_from_esummary} is  provided for the specific case of extracting
named elements from a list of esummary objects, and is designed to work on
single objects as well as lists.
